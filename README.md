# pet_classifier_unet

## Description
This repository stores a UNET neural network trained with the [Oxford iiit](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/) dataset, containerized in an Ubuntu 20.04 Docker container. The neural network was trained in a Google Colab Notebook and stored in the file `dejando_huella.ipynb`, since the training takes considerably less time with a GPU, a colab T4 GPU.
